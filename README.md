# Diabetes-ml-project

This program predicts whether a patient could potentially have diabetes based on features such as their BMI, glucose level, pregnancy status, skin thickness and more. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.com. In this dataset, all the patients are 21+ year old women from India. 

# Intro 

As my first Machine Learning project, I was looking forward to jumping in to using Python ML Libraries and use Google Collabs to build this project. More than anything, I pursued this project as the first thing I could do to helping people. Although numerous projects like this exist, I delved into this learning experience in order to practice ML programming skills and theory. I had read and taken courses on ML algorithms and formulas, theory behind regression and cost functions, yet had never actually applied what I had learned. 

# Purpose
I used this project to gain a better understanding of the following topics: 

- Data modeling
- Model evaluation
- Data analysis
- Model deployment
